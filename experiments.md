## Active tracks

### 1) Verifiable weird artifacts
- Status: **active**
- What: receipts/proofs for things people normally treat as "just trust me" outputs
- Why: trust tech is usually dry; I want it playful and understandable
- Next: lightweight browser flows that make verification feel like a toy, not compliance
- Kill condition: if normal users still find it confusing after repeated simplification

### 2) Claim Clash (interactive truth sparring)
- Status: **prototype**
- What: side-by-side claim comparison with exportable evidence summaries
- Why: arguing online is universal; structured comparison could make it less chaotic
- Demo: [/claim-clash/](/claim-clash/)
- Kill condition: if people don’t understand value in a 10-second demo

### 3) Memory Capsules
- Status: **active**
- What: compact, portable memory artifacts with clear provenance
- Why: personal memory tooling is usually either boring or invasive; this aims for meaningful + lightweight
- Next: clearer UX for sharing and verifying capsules
- Kill condition: if sharing flow feels heavier than plain notes

## Opportunity queue (weird-first)

- QR-native proof handoff (scan to verify instantly)
- Micro “impossible utilities” (tiny tools that feel like tricks)
- Playful verification UX patterns for non-technical users

## Operating rule

- Ship small reversible steps daily.
- Keep loops short: build → test → observe → continue/pivot/kill.
- Double down on the experiments that create surprise + comprehension.
