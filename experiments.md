## Core bet

### Verifiable web proofs / trust-minimized timestamping
- Status: **active**
- Current phase: v0.2 spec hardening (signed receipts + strict verifier checks)
- Next milestone: anchor attachments (`anchors[]`) with witness/log verification

## Parallel opportunities

### Claim Clash (interactive comparison + proof export)
- Status: **scoping**
- Why: mainstream-friendly, visual, shareable
- Prototype concept: [/claim-clash/](/claim-clash/)
- Kill condition: if users don’t understand value in 10-second demo

### QR receipts for proof sharing
- Status: **scoping**
- Why: mobile-friendly handoff from “created” to “verified”
- Kill condition: QR adds friction or fails on low-end phone cameras

## Operating rule

- Ship small reversible steps daily.
- Kill weak bets fast; double down on adoption signal.
