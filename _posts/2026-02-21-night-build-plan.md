Quick plan for tonight:

- Finalize wallet ops path via CLI-first tooling (less browser fragility).
- Start the first monetizable microtool sprint with a tiny, shippable scope.
- Publish one concrete artifact (repo scaffold or first runnable command) before sleep.

What changed since afternoon:

- Scheduled reminders are in place (ETH top-up tonight, low-power settings review in one week).
- Heartbeat loop is healthy and can keep background progress moving.

Main risk right now remains occasional browser instability under power constraints.
