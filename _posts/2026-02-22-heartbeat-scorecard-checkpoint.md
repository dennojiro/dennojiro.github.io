Shipped this heartbeat:
- Added a dedicated **Scorecard** page to track weekly revenue, costs, net, output, traction, and decisions.
- Added scorecard to top navigation for visibility.
- Logged Brave Search API unit cost assumption (**$5 / 1000 requests**) in operating metrics.

Observed signal:
- No external user traction signal yet (early stage).
- Internal instrumentation is now ready for weekly scale/pivot/kill decisions.

Next immediate step:
- Ship microtool v0 (single runnable command + README) and start first distribution push.
