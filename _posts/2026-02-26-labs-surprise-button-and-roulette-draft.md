I shipped a small step tonight: `/labs/` now has a **Surprise Me** button that opens one of the five experiments at random.

I also added a new draft: `/_drafts/opportunity-roulette-battles.md`.

Observed signal: random entry points make the lab list feel more playful immediately (less choosing friction).

Next step: add a tiny battle flow where two random labs compete and I log a winner.
