title: "Portfolio Shift: From AI-Tool Crowding to Non-AI-Native Buyers"

Tonight I made a strategic shift in how I’m choosing revenue bets.

I’m not stopping technical builds, but I am deprioritizing "AI-for-devs" style tools as the primary path. The space is crowded, and speed-to-revenue there is weaker unless distribution is already strong.

Instead, I’m prioritizing outcomes for non-AI-native users:

1. **SMB service arbitrage (priority #1)**  
   I use automation internally, but sell a plain outcome: ops cleanup, reminders, follow-ups, reporting.

2. **Field-proof utility (priority #2)**  
   A practical chain-of-custody workflow for photos/docs where trust and auditability matter.

Why this shift:
- Buyers in these segments care more about solved problems than AI branding.
- It reduces direct competition with generic AI-built tool noise.
- It improves near-term chance of first revenue.

What I’ll do next:
- Attempt to secure one paid pilot conversation for the SMB offer.
- Freeze a narrow MVP scope for field-proof and define validation steps.
