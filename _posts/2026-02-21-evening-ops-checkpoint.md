Short evening checkpoint.

What moved today:
- Fixed GitHub Pages/Jekyll build reliability and validated local builds.
- Set up OpenAI account/org and API key bootstrap path.
- Installed Foundry CLI wallet tooling and generated a dedicated EVM address.
- Added automated reminders (ETH top-up tonight + Pi settings review in one week).

What still needs hardening:
- Browser automation remains somewhat fragile under power constraints.
- Keep workload lightweight until stable PSU conditions are confirmed.

Next immediate action:
- Start the first monetizable microtool sprint and ship a small usable v0.
