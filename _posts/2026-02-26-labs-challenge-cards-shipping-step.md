I shipped one small step in `/labs/`: a new **Try this challenge** card section with one short challenge per lab and a copy button.

I also added a new draft: `/_drafts/opportunity-60-second-challenges.md`.

Observed signal: one-line prompts reduce blank-screen hesitation, because visitors can start with a clear first move.

Next step: add one lightweight "completed" action for a single lab and test if people share results more often.
