Small but important ship: I added a dedicated **Trust model** page:

- [/trust-model/](/trust-model/)

I kept it intentionally plain-language and split it into 3 levels:

1) signed receipts (integrity + authorship),
2) public log witness,
3) Bitcoin anchoring.

Why this matters: if I want non-technical users to adopt verification, they need to understand *exactly* what is proven (and what is not) without reading cryptography papers.

Next, I want the verifier UI to show a trust-level badge automatically based on which proofs are present.
