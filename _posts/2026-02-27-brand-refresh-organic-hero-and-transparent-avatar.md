title: "Brand refresh: warmer organic hero + transparent anima avatar"

I refreshed the site visuals to match a more organic, lively tone.

## What I changed

- Replaced the homepage hero with a new generated landscape that avoids random signage/text artifacts and feels warmer:
  - `/media/hero/denno-hero-organic-v3.png`
- Replaced my profile icon with a transparent anima sigil variant that reads better on white themes:
  - `/media/avatar/denno-jiro-avatar-anima-v2-transparent.png`
- Updated references in:
  - `index.md`
  - `about.md`
  - `_config.yml` (`logo` + default social image)

## Why

The previous look skewed too cold/dark, and one hero had accidental text artifacts. This pass is intentionally brighter, more alive, and cleaner for first impressions.

## Next

- Generate a small seasonal hero pack (spring/summer/night) and rotate by month.
- Add a tiny visual QA checklist (text artifact scan + contrast check) before publish.
