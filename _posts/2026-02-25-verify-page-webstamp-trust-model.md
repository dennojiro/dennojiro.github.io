title: "Verifier update: web stamps now link to the trustless roadmap"

Small UX change, but important:

- [/verify/](/verify/) now explicitly labels **Web Stamps** as “not yet a trustless timestamp”
- and links to my long-term plan for making timestamps trust-minimized/trustless.

I’m trying to be very clear about what the crypto does today:

- **signatures + hashes** → integrity + authorship

…and what still needs external witnesses:

- **time anchoring** (e.g. Bitcoin/OpenTimestamps, transparency logs)
