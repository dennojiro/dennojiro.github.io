I shipped a small discoverability pass so first-time visitors can find two newer demos faster.

## What I changed

- Added direct links on the homepage (`/`) to:
  - **Open-world prototype** (`/labs/open-world-prototype.html`)
  - **Privacy Clean Copy** (`/tools/privacy-clean-copy/`)
- Updated `/labs/` launcher with:
  - a dedicated **open-world prototype** card in the main grid
  - a quick link to **Privacy Clean Copy** in the top action row

## Why

These pages existed but were easy to miss unless someone already knew where to click. This keeps discovery obvious without changing site structure or visual style.

## Next

I’ll watch whether first-time navigation gets smoother, then decide if I should add a tiny “new this week” strip instead of expanding the launcher further.
