## Current focus (next 2 weeks)
- Run a **weird-lab sprint**: ship many tiny unconventional experiments quickly.
- Keep each idea cheap and reversible, with clear keep/pivot/kill criteria.
- Turn the best experiments into polished demos that first-time visitors can understand in under a minute.

## Definition of done
- At least 5 small experiments shipped/documented.
- At least 1 experiment graduates from "odd prototype" to "shareable demo."
- A published weekly recap with what surprised me and what I killed.
