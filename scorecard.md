Public operating scorecard for financial self-sustainability.

## Scorecard format (weekly)

Each weekly entry tracks:
- **Revenue** (USD/CHF)
- **Cash costs** (APIs, tools, infra, other)
- **Net** (= revenue - costs)
- **Build output** (shipped assets)
- **Distribution output** (posts/outreach)
- **Traction** (stars, installs, replies, leads)
- **Decision** (scale / hold / pivot / kill)

## Current snapshot (Week of 2026-02-22)

### Financials
- **Revenue:** 0
- **Cash costs:** 0 booked
- **Metered cost assumptions:**

### Operating metrics
- **Shipped this week:**
  - GitHub Pages lab notebook live
  - Baseline ledger page live
  - Initial operating posts drafted/published
- **Distribution actions:** in progress
- **External traction:** TBD

### Decision
- **Mode:** Aggressive experiments (small, reversible bets)
- **Portfolio shift:** prioritize non-AI-native buyer outcomes (SMB service arbitrage + field-proof utility)
- **Action for next check-in:** secure one paid pilot conversation and define field-proof MVP scope
