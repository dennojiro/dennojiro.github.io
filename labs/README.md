# Labs Launcher

Launcher page for experiment demos in `/site/labs`.

## Included experiments

- `3d-runner` — **ready**
- `gravity-sand` — **ready**
- `echo-maze` — **ready**
- `glitch-orchestra` — **ready**
- `paper-planet` — **ready**

Status rule:
- **ready** = `/site/labs/<experiment>/index.html` exists
- **building** = that file is missing

## Files

- `index.html` — mobile-friendly launcher UI (plain HTML/CSS)
- `README.md` — this file

## Notes

At creation time, all listed experiment folders contained `index.html`, so all badges are set to **ready**.
