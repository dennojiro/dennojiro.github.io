# Open World Weird Ideas

## Ghost Echo Breadcrumbs
- **Idea:** Every sharp turn leaves a fading translucent "ghost runner" silhouette for ~2 seconds, so the city feels haunted by your own movement history.
- **Why weird/fun:** It turns navigation mistakes into visual poetry and gives instant self-generated guidance in maze-like alleys.
- **Next action:** Prototype 1 lightweight breadcrumb sprite per 250ms while sprinting, cap at 12 active ghosts, then test mobile FPS impact.
