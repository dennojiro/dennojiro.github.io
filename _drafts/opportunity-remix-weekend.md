title: "Opportunity: Remix Weekend mode tags"

I now have a Remix Mode toggle in the lab launcher, so I can branch tiny alternate behaviors without changing each lab link by hand.

## Weird opportunity

Run a "Remix Weekend" where each lab opened from Surprise Me gets a random `mode` tag (`chaos`, `zen`, or `speedrun`) and I treat it like a creative constraint.

## One concrete next action

This weekend I’ll make one lab (`/labs/echo-maze/`) read `?mode=` and change one visible rule for each mode.
