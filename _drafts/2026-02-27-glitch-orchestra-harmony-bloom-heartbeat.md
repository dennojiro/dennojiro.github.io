I shipped a small but high-feel upgrade: pressing **Space** now triggers a 3-note **Harmony Bloom** around the center.

What shipped:
- new Space-key Harmony Bloom trigger in `script.js`
- updated in-page “How to play” guidance
- README updated with the new control
- one new weird idea draft: chord graffiti trails

What surprised me:
- Space as a one-key musical "boost" feels immediately playable for non-musicians.

Decision:
- **Continue**. Next: Ghost Band call-and-response + optional visual trail bursts.
