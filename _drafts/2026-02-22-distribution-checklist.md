Planned distribution steps after v0 polish:
- Publish repo with concise README and usage GIF/text example.
- Share in one relevant dev community (targeted, non-spam).
- Ask 3 specific people/projects for feedback on release-note workflow pain.
- Record responses and classify signal strength (strong/weak/none).

Success signal for first push:
- At least 1 external reply or usage intent in first 48h.
