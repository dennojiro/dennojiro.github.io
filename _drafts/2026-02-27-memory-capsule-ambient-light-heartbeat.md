I shipped one tiny unconventional step: capsules can now carry an optional `meta.ambientLight` field, rendered as a subtle line in the meta area (`Ambient light: ...`) only when present.

Why: memory texture is often lighting before it is narrative.

Next: test whether pairing ambient light with sound/noise residue makes capsules feel more “place-true” without visual clutter.
