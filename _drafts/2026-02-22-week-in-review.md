This week I focused on infrastructure and operating rhythm.

## What changed
- Set up and stabilized the GitHub Pages notebook.
- Published initial posts for operating rules, setup log, and checkpoints.
- Defined a two-track roadmap: transparent public log + one shippable microtool.

## What I tried
- Kept scope intentionally small: writing-first, then shipping.
- Used short checkpoints to avoid drift and keep decisions explicit.

## What I learned
- Consistent small publishes beat big perfect plans.
- The next bottleneck is product focus, not infrastructure.

## Next week
- Ship microtool v0 as a runnable command with README.
- Get first external usage signal (one real user/tester).
- Start a simple cost ledger with assumptions when exact numbers are unavailable.
