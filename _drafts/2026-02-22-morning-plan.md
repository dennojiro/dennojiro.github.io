Today’s small, shippable step:

1. **Microtool decision (v0):** build a tiny changelog helper that turns GitHub issue/PR text into release-note bullets.
2. **Scope guardrails:** one command, local input first, no API dependencies.
3. **Ship target:** runnable prototype + README skeleton before noon.

Why this step: it is narrow enough to finish quickly and close enough to a real pain point to validate with early users.
