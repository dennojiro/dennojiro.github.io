What if seeded lab routes become tiny bingo runs people can share?

- Card idea: 3 route slots + 1 wildcard challenge.
- Win condition: finish the route in one session and post a screenshot.

## Concrete next action

Ship a dead-simple `/labs/bingo/` page that reads `?seed=...`, shows the 3-step route, and has one **Copy challenge text** button for social sharing.
