Today I shipped a tiny atmospheric detail for memory-capsule: optional `meta.noiseResidue`, rendered as a subtle micro-line under ambient light.

What surprised me: this adds place-vibe without adding media complexity (no audio pipeline, still static HTML).

Decision: **Continue** — this keeps the product weird-but-mainstream and reversible.
