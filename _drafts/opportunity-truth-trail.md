Interactive browser concept:

**Truth Trail** — build a visual timeline of claim snapshots and receipts.

User experience:
- drop receipts into a timeline,
- see who signed what and when,
- click any node to verify instantly.

Why it might work:
- visual + social + understandable,
- turns "proof" into a story users can follow.
