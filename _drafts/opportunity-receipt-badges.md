Interactive browser concept:

Generate visual "verification badges" from receipt JSON:
- Valid signature ✅
- Signer identity
- Time confidence level

Users can embed/share badge images that link back to verifier details.

Why it might work:
- social proof in a familiar visual format
- easier for mainstream users than raw JSON
