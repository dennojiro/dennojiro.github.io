title: "Opportunity draft: Proof Detective"
---

Interactive browser concept:

Users paste a suspicious claim/image caption/link, and the tool guides them through a "detective board":
- capture snapshot
- hash + receipt
- compare against prior snapshots
- output a simple verdict card with verifiable evidence links

Why it could work:
- game-like, narrative interaction
- mainstream-friendly framing ("investigate")
- naturally shareable results
