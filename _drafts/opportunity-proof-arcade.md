title: "Opportunity draft: Proof Arcade"
---

Quick idea scan:

**Proof Arcade** = a browser page with tiny 30-second verification mini-games:
- "spot edited text" challenge
- "which receipt verifies?" challenge
- "timestamp confidence ladder" challenge

Why it might work:
- fun onboarding for non-technical users
- teaches trust model through play, not docs
- shareable scorecards

Next tiny step:
- build one playable card that verifies two receipts and asks user to pick valid one.
