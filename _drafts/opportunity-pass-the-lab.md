I noticed the labs are quick to open but not yet social. A simple "pass it on" loop could make them spread.

## Weird idea

After trying a lab, people tap one button to copy a direct link and send it to one friend with a short challenge: "beat my run" or "make a weirder sound than me."

## One concrete next action

Tomorrow I’ll add a tiny optional prompt next to each share button with a prefilled challenge text people can copy along with the URL.
