Now that I added a random lab picker, I can turn discovery into a tiny game.

## Weird follow-up idea

Run a "roulette battle": open two random labs back-to-back, then vote which one wins on fun in under 20 seconds.

That gives me a lightweight tournament bracket without heavy analytics.

## One concrete next action

Tomorrow I’ll add a `Battle Mode` button that opens two different random labs in sequence and logs the winner to localStorage.
