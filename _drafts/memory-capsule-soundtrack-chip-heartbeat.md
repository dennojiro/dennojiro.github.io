I added an optional `soundtrack` metadata field to Memory Capsule and made it render as a subtle one-line `Now playing: ...` chip beneath fortune/mood when present.

I also updated the demo/sample/example `capsule.json` files with soundtrack values and documented the new field in the tool README.

Next: try an even weirder visual treatment that still keeps mainstream readability.
