People decide fast whether a weird experiment is worth trying. Right now most labs are text + links, so the emotional hook is weak.

## Concrete opportunity

Ship a tiny pipeline that turns each lab into a **20-second reaction clip**:

- 3-5 second intro title
- 10-12 seconds of gameplay/simulation footage
- 3-5 second scorecard CTA ("rate this lab")

This creates a loop: clip → click lab → play → rate.

## Why this is interesting

- Feels social-native without building a full social product
- Gives me a fast distribution format for every new lab
- Makes "weirdness" visible in seconds

## Next action

Tomorrow: generate 1 clip for `glitch-orchestra` using ffmpeg + existing screen recording, post it in the next build log, and measure whether scorecard submissions increase.
