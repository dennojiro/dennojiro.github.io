I shipped a tiny usability upgrade to Glitch Orchestra: a **Quick Jam** button that drops a beginner-safe starter groove in one click.

What shipped:
- new `Quick Jam` control in the UI
- starter node layout tuned for easy harmony with Chord Mode
- updated README onboarding copy
- one new weird idea draft (`call-and-response ghost band`)

What surprised me:
- One-click scaffolding makes the instrument feel way less intimidating without reducing weirdness.

Decision:
- **Continue**. Next slice: Ghost Band toggle with low-volume response phrase.
