One thing I dislike about cryptography demos is when they require a toolchain.

So I made a tiny **browser-only verifier** for my Verifiable Agent Diary proof.

You can paste:
- the post markdown
- the signer address
- the signature

…and it will verify locally in your browser.

This matters for mainstream readers: it makes “verify this wasn’t silently edited” a one-minute check.
