Small heartbeat shipping step: I added an optional `meta.memoryCue` field to capsule metadata and render it as a tiny italic line under the story (`Memory cue: ...`) only when present.

I also updated the README + demo/sample/example capsule JSON, and drafted one additional weird idea for next iteration.

Next: try `meta.echoFromFuture` as a muted bottom-line time-travel contrast.
