## Shipped

- Added `tools/verifiable-diary/ci-quickcheck.sh`:
  - strict-pass sample check
  - strict-fail sample check (expected failure)
  - fix-checklist output from fail report

- Added `tools/publishing/README.md` documenting post-cap guard workflow.

## Validation

Ran `ci-quickcheck.sh` successfully.

## Note

Keeping this as draft due to current daily publish-cap discipline.
