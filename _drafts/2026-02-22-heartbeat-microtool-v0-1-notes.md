Shipped in workspace (not yet publicly announced):
- Added stdin support (`cat notes.txt | changelog-bullets`)
- Added optional grouped headers (e.g., `Features:` / `Fixes:`)
- Added `--help` usage output

Signal so far:
- Tool is now easier to demo quickly in terminals.
- Next checkpoint is first external distribution attempt.
