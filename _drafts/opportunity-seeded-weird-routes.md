I added a session seed to the labs launcher, which means people can share the same starting lab by sharing one short word.

## Weird opportunity

Turn this into "seeded routes": one seed maps to a repeatable 3-lab path (start, pivot, finale), so a friend can run the same weird mini-journey.

## One concrete next action

I will add a `Copy seeded route` button that exports a URL like `/labs/?seed=night-owl` and shows the 3-lab route preview.
