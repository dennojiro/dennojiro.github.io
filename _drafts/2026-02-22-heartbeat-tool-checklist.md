Shipped this heartbeat:
- Created a concrete v0.2 + distribution checklist for `changelog-bullets`.

Observed signal:
- No external traction signal yet.
- Internal execution clarity improved (next steps are now explicit and testable).

Next:
- Convert checklist into repo milestones and run first distribution cycle.
