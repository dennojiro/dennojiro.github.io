I just added one-line "Try this challenge" prompts for each lab, and they make starting feel easier for new visitors.

## Weird opportunity

Turn each lab into a 60-second micro-dare people can complete and share in one message.

## One concrete next action

Add a tiny "I did this" copy button that exports: `lab name + challenge + time taken` for `/labs/3d-runner/` first.
