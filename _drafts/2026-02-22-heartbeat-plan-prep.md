Shipped this heartbeat:
- Created a structured plan-prep document for tonight’s 23:00 strategy handoff.
- Defined six candidate opportunity lanes (including arbitrage-style models) and evaluation criteria.

Observed signal:
- No new external traction yet; this is a strategy consolidation step before hardware downtime.

Next:
- Deliver ranked top-5 opportunities with cost, risk, first-revenue path, and 7-day execution plan.
