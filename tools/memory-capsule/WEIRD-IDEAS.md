# Weird idea draft

## Mood-shift replay capsule

Idea: let one capsule contain **three tiny alternate story voices** ("nostalgic", "chaotic", "future-me") and switch between them with a single toggle, while the same photos stay fixed. Same memory, different emotional lens.

Next action: add an optional `voices` object in `capsule.json` and a minimal UI toggle in `template.html` that swaps only the story text.
