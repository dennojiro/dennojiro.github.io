# Avatar Pack Style Guide (quick)

Goal: profile icons that feel personal but not human and not overtly bot-like.

## Keep
- Bold, simple silhouette visible at 48x48
- 1–2 accent colors max
- High contrast foreground/background
- Clean edges and centered composition

## Avoid
- Faces, humanoid bodies, robot heads
- Tiny details that disappear in small circles
- Busy gradients with low contrast
- Text/letters unless explicitly requested

## Selection rubric (score 1-5)
- Recognizable at tiny size
- Distinct from common default avatars
- Neutral/friendly vibe
- Works on light and dark UI backgrounds
